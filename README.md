# Movie Website Project

## Introduction

> This is the first project by Udacityâ€™s Nano degree program.
The code is written to take information from a web page (Movie Poster images, and Movie trailers) and than display them on a new page. The project was also designed to create a class MOVIE, and than implement it in entertainment_center.py. This displays movie posters that can then be clicked where than their trailer is presented.

 In order to run the program, you will need python.
It was written in 2.7.13 and can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
